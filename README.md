# sfcli

A experimental rest client to salesforce (API v 44).

My environment is macos (linux/darwin) with python3 v 3.7.1. It's possible that this will run on other platforms and versions. Cross platform is out of scope, basically you need some OS with Python and a text editor, and internet access, and at some point in the project you need a salesforce instance with admin access, e.g. a free developer instance from www.salesforce.com.
